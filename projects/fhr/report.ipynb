    "The Fluoride-Cooled High Temperature Reactor (FHR) is a generation IV design which boasts attractive safety features and economic properties; The FLIBE/NAFZIRF coolant proposed for use in FHRs is supplied to the secondary coolant loop at temperatures approaching 700 $^{\\circ}$C, far in excess of outflow coolant temperatures seen in water-cooled designs, which results in higher Brayton cycle efficiency and opens the door for use in applications which require very high temperature process heat. Furthermore, cooling during shutdown is accomplished through natural convection, improving safety and reliability as well as lowering capital costs significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design itself shares similarities with the High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR). Fuel is present in the form of spherical pellets rather than the cylindrical ones used in more conventional reactors; The reactor itself consists of an anular space within concentric cylinders within which the primary coolant flows and the fuel pellets are introduced. As the fuel pellets are less dense than the surrounding salt, they will slowly be buoyed up to the top of the reactor if they are introduced continuously at the bottom, with a residence time of about two months. Pellets can hence be introduced and removed from the reactor continuously, with no need to shut down for refueling. Primary coolant also flows within this channel around the fuel pebbles, as shown in the following diagram:\n",

    "Significant amounts of coolant also flow through the central graphite reflector in channels a few centimeters in diameter:\n",
